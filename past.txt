						<h3><em><img src="Martone.jpg" alt="" width="130" height="130" class="alignleft border" /></em>Martone</h3>
						<p>No stranger to the world of music, Martone’s years of experience in television, radio, and now music have earned him both recognition and respect. Martone first realized his passion for entertainment after a televised performance at his first school play at the tender age of seven years old. Originally from Lansing, Michigan, he is often described as an impassioned visionary, poised to become one of the most recognized names in the entertainment industry. 
							 <br>
							<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
							The positive feedback from the audience at a young age, no doubt helped to cement his determination to succeed. At the age of 13 years old, Martone became one of the youngest television producers/directors at Continental Cablevision public access producer’s course and produced his very own music video program called Video Control. Video Control aired on channel 37 Monday nights at 10:00 p.m. for 13 seasons. During that time, Martone had the opportunity to interview such celebrities as Will Smith, Queen Latifah, En Vogue, Vanilla Ice, Public Enemy, UNV, and many more. Soon after the conclusion of Video Control, Martone moved to Detroit, Michigan to pursue his passion and further his education in television production and graduated from Specs Howard School of Media Arts. From there he wanted to take his career in television to a higher level, sadly due to the economic downturn of 2008, it was not meant to be. 

						Initially, the song had been scheduled for release on March 1, 2019, but due to the success of Good Love, he did not want to interfere with the promotion of that song. So, Love Out Loud was released on May 31, 2019, to critical acclaim. On November 21, 2019, Martone won The Silver Medal Award for Outstanding Achievement with the Erogenous Zone album in the Electronic Dance Music category. On March 17, 2020, Martone was nominated for a Detroit Music Award for Outstanding Electronic Recording Erogenous Zone. Due to COVID-19, Martone did not attend the awards ceremony. Due to the worldwide pandemic, and the social unrest of 2020, Martone was unable to perform due to social distancing, and mandatory shutdowns. Later in the year, a few people had started planting the seed asking when and if he was going to bring the radio station back. “I knew that I wanted to do it, but it has to be done the right way, it needs to be bigger and better than before.”On October 27, 2020, Martone incorporated IRMIX Radio, LLC and set a relaunch date of Monday, March 1, 2021, exactly eight years to the day when IRMIX Radio premiered the first time. Upon the relaunch of IRMIX Radio in March 2021, listeners can expect to be able to stream the station anywhere in the world through IRMIX Radio’s website, a ROKU television app, and a monthly magazine that will be available for order only upon demand. The station will still offer the initial staples of the terrestrial programming but seeks to add high-quality talk shows and seeks to serve as a one-stop-shop for all thing’s entertainment and more.“It is my mission to create a legacy that will last beyond me, IRMIX Radio is here to stay.”
